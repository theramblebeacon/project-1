        <p>The Siskiyou Crest is a magical place, that was chosen at some point to play host to a road: FR20.</p>
        <p>The 20 road, as we tend to call it, clings to the ridgeline of the crest as much as it can, and that means wide-open views in all directions.  Mount Shasta looms white and cloud-ringed to the south; Mount McLaughlin stands pointy-topped to the north; and all around the seemingly enless mashes of mountains and ridges and valleys spread out below you.</p>
