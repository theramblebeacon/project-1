            <p>I want to travel the world to observe its workings.  So much of what goes on in life feels like it's beyond my grasp, but not beyond my wonder to behold, so that's what I try to do.</p>
            <p>To begin at the beginning isn't alway the best way to learbn about something because life is a series of digressions and tengents, and those elements are really what keep it interesting.</p>
            <p>Setting out to learn and understand more than I currently do is my point of departure, but what form that quest will take is often hard to see beforehand.</p>
